# single-cell-RNA-seq-analysis-of-PBMC-data

I have used the PBMC single cell data from the 10X and analyzed using the latest tools.

Once I got the processed files from the website, I performed-
QC- scater package
Cell cycle scoring - scater
Normalization, Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, plots - Seurat
Data Integration- Harmony, Seurat (merge)
Differential expression - scran, scater
Trajector inference- Monocle
